            My name is Loan RIYANTO, I'm currently at Velizy's IUT, studying for a BA in MMI. I've chosen this formation because I'm gaining interest in development. I always liked to create, especially on softwares, and I've always been on computers

                <h3><span class="highlight">Education</span></h3><br>
                I’m currently at my first year of BUT MMI (Multimedia) at the Velizy’s IUT (Institute of technology). We are studying different subjects such as communication, web development, English,  graphism and cinema. All these subjects are linked since we need to be versatile. We will specialize in year 2 either in Web Development or in Graphism, and I'm going to chose graphism. Communication might be useful if I want to do advertising for my website, English if I want my website to be in French and English, graphism if I need to add any logos etc...
                <br><br>During middle school, I was in Sainte Marie’s school, Antony. I then moved to Sophie Barart’s high school, Verrières-le-buisson where I chose STMG department. This summer, I’ve attempted the 42 coding school. I learned a lot from this 1 month-period exam.
