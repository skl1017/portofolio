          <h3><span class="highlight">Full stack web developer</span></h3><br>
          Full stack web developer is a person who is working in front end and back end which means he can develop both client and server software. He is making websites and is managing the display of the website (with Html, Css, Js...) but also what's happening behind (manage the databases, etc... with PHP, SQL, Python...)
          <br><br>As a full stack developer (and developer in general), the employer does not care about how you're writting your code or how much hours you've spent on it. The only thing that matters is the result at a given deadline. Which means you can make arrangements in your agenda and truly work. It also gives you a better balance between your professional and personal life.
          <br>Full stack developers earn between 38 000€ and 42 000€ per year.
